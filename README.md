# zoom-client-events
Linux tool to perform shell commands on new zoom chat message, entering or leaving a meeting, when all messages have been read.

## Motivation
The linux zoom client does not yet feature individual audio output settings for notification sounds and for meeting audio. I wanted to have notification sounds played back on my speakers while I want to use a headset for meetings. Also I like to listen to music on the speakers and got tired of manually pausing/resuming that when joining or leaving a meeting. These things usually should be no problem using linux, adding command calls to any of the events.
In the end I even integrated smart lighting actions when those scripts get called. But that's all up to your imagingation.

## Pre-Requisites
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with python3.
